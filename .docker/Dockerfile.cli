# Strating from this line, Docker will add result of each command into a
# separate layer. These layers are then cached, and re-used when project is
# rebuilt.
# Note that layers are rebuilt only if files added into image with `ADD`
# have changed since the last build. So adding files that are most like to be
# rarely changed earlier in the build process (closer to the start of this
# file) adds more efficiency when working with stack - layers will be rarely
# rebuilt.
